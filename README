x86devirt
============
This is a project that aims to devirtualize & disassemble applications that
have been virtualized using x86virt.

It is a reverse engineering project and all implementation seen here was
reverse engineered out of a protected binary file / crackme hosted on
tuts4you.com at the following address: https://tuts4you.com/download/1850/

x86 Virtualizer is an open source project located at the following URL:
https://github.com/rwfpl/rewolf-x86-virtualizer

Since this project aims to build practical experience reverse engineering
applciations protected using a VM, the open source project was never
referenced during the development of this project and all implementation is
based entirely on what has been reverse engineered out of protected executables.
